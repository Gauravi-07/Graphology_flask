# Graphology_flask
<p>This is a Flask web application that predicts personality traits based on handwriting analysis. The app leverages machine learning models that are trained on handwriting images and feature extraction across five Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, it includes a specialized model to determine whether a person is introverted or extroverted based on their Hindi handwriting.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Handwriting Analysis</strong>: The app processes handwriting samples and extracts features that reveal various personality traits.</li>
    <li><strong>Personality Trait Prediction</strong>: Uses models trained in multiple Jupyter notebooks to predict characteristics such as emotional stability, openness, and conscientiousness.</li>
    <li><strong>Hindi Handwriting Analysis</strong>: An additional feature that focuses on Hindi handwriting, predicting whether a person is introverted or extroverted.</li>
    <li><strong>Airwriting Recognition</strong>: Incorporates an airwriting feature (Notebook_4) to analyze handwriting traced in the air.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning Models</strong>: Models are built using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and trained across multiple notebooks for different aspects of personality analysis.</li>
</ul>
